# üéº AkordAI

**AkordAI** is an open-source organization focused on building declarative, modular tools for designing and executing Agentic AI systems.

At its core is a powerful **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)** for defining reasoning agents, AI components, tool integrations, contextual memory, and multi-agent workflows ‚Äî enabling developers to compose intelligent behavior through orchestration, not just code.

---

## üß† What We Build

- **üìú Declarative DSL** ‚Äî to define agent capabilities, goals, tools, workflows, memory usage, and execution logic
- **üß© Agent Infrastructure** ‚Äî including reasoning strategies, skills, instructions, memory binding, and tool use
- **‚öôÔ∏è Runtimes & Executors** ‚Äî for single-agent flows, parallel agent collaboration, and convergent decision-making
- **üß† Memory Systems** ‚Äî static, vector, file-based, and key-value memory for context retrieval and learning
- **üîå Toolset Integration** ‚Äî OpenAPI and MCP-based tools that agents can invoke during reasoning
- **üåç Provider Abstraction** ‚Äî support for OpenAI, Azure, HuggingFace, Ollama, Redis, Qdrant, and more

## ‚ú® What Does "AkordAI" Mean?

**AkordAI** stands for:

> **A**gentic  
> **K**nowledge  
> **O**rchestration for  
> **R**easoning and  
> **D**ecision-making in  
> **A**rtificial  
> **I**ntelligence

It also evokes the idea of an **"accord"** ‚Äî a harmonious composition ‚Äî reflecting our vision of intelligent agents reasoning together, in sync.
