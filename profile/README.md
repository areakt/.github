# 🧠 Areakt

**Areakt** is a modular, agentic reasoning and action toolkit — a flexible DSL and orchestration framework for building AI workflows grounded in **reasoning**, **tool use**, and **task execution**.

> **Areakt** = *Agentic Reason + Act on Knowledge & Tasks*

---

## ✨ What is Areakt?

Areakt helps you define, compose, and execute AI agent workflows using a simple, declarative language. It’s inspired by the ReAct pattern, enriched with task-awareness, memory, planning, and modular integration.

Whether you're using Semantic Kernel, LangChain, or your own LLM orchestration stack, **Areakt** provides a unified way to describe and run agent workflows that reason, decide, and act.

---

## ✅ Core Concepts

- **Reason → Act**: All agents follow a thought → action → observation loop.
- **Tasks & Tools**: Define knowledge-based or external function calls.
- **Plans & Flows**: Orchestrate sequences or trees of actions.
- **Multi-agent Ready**: Compose specialized agents for grammar, accuracy, decisions, etc.
- **Language-Agnostic**: YAML/JSON spec; can be executed in any backend.

## 🧭 Philosophy

Areakt embraces a **"thought-first" agent architecture** — where reasoning, memory, tools, and goals work together to produce explainable, context-rich outputs from AI agents.

```
Reason → Plan → Act → Observe → Repeat
```
